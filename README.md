# whatAreYouDoing?
An applescript that asks you what you are doing at a user defined interval, using terminal-notifier dialogs, and records it into a text file on your desktop with time stamps

The only dependency for this project is `terminal-notifier`, available via `brew`. If you have brew installed, WAYD will try and install this dependency for you?

If you are set up to use Orbot, please note you can use WAYD to input information into your timesheet.

Simply format your input as: ```<task id> <action notes>``` and WAYD will do the rest, using Orbot (special thanks to Joe Haines!)

Please edit away as is usefull by opening Script Editor on your mac, and opening the .app file with it.

Feel free to PR away with reckless abandon
